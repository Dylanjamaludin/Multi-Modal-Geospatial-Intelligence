# Multi-Modal Geospatial Intelligence

## Objective

Develop a geospatial intelligence application using multi-modal models (Segment Anything Model, OpenAl's CLIP, QA) for zero-shot classification in computer vision tasks, leveraging geospatial datasets like RSICD.

## Key Requirements

1. Integration of Multi-Modal Models
    - Combine vision and language models for accurate classifications and responses.
2. Zero-Shot Classification
    - Leverage the zero-shot classification capabilities of multi-modal models for real-time insights.
3. Geospatial Data Utilization
    - Efficiently process and analyze geospatial datasets to extract valuable insights.
4. User-Friendly Interface
    - Create an intuitive interface for easy navigation and understanding of results.

## Impact

 This project has the potential to revolutionize geospatial data processing and analysis in various sectors like environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management. It can also inspire the development of similar applications in other domains.
